        <ol>
            <li>
                 We need to get our meat to room temperature 
                first. Take your meat out of the fridge for about
                30-45 minutes.
            </li>
            <li> 
                Once the ribeye is room temperature, pat dry with a paper towel.
                Season with salt & pepper.We need to heat up our skillet(iron cast skillet preferred) to the point 
                that is smoking to sear the surface of the steak. We are going to cook the 
                steak for a total of 5 minutes(medium rare to medium).
                Cook it or under cook it a minute longer depends on how
                you want your steak cooked.
            </li>
            <li>
                Once hot enough, put enough cooking oil to cover the skillet.
                We are going to sear each side of the steak for about a minute. 
                (note: keep flipping each side for a minute to cook it evenly on 
                both sides)              
            </li>
            <li>
                Lower the heat to medium and put the butter,garlic,rosemary,
                thyme into the skillet. Let the butter melt and baste the steak
                with the sauce. Remember to keep flipping.
            </li>

            <li> 
                After a total of 5 minutes or however long you cooked it, let the steak rest 
                outside of the heat and let sit for 10 minutes.  
            </li>

            <li> 
                Slice meat along the grain for a more chewable texture and Enjoy
                your perfectly cooked steak.
